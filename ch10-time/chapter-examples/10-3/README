Demonstrates the use of strptime() and strftime().

This program takes a command-line argument containing a date and time,
converts this to a broken-down time using strptime(), and then displays
the result of performing the reverse conversion using strftime()

The program takes up to 3 arguments, of which the first 2 are required.
    arg1: string containing a date and time
    arg2: format specification to be used by strptime()
    arg3: format string to be used by strftime() for the reverse conversion (a default string is used if this arg is omitted)

Example runs:
    ./strtime "9:39:46pm 1 Feb 2011" "%I:%M:%S%p %d %b %Y"
    ./strtime "9:39:46pm 1 Feb 2011" "%I:%M:%S%p %d %b %Y" "%F %T"
