This chapter was pretty straight forward

It discussed I/O buffering in both the user space and by
the kernel.

The stdio library already buffers the user-space data for the kernel
to improve performance, and messing with the kernel buffer abilities
can severely degrade performance, especially in smaller size byte transfers.

Regardless, you can modify the kernel buffering mechanism to sync
data to the disk, or to sync data and file metadata to the disk on
each read/write.
