Problem:

Write a program that opens an existing file for writing with the O_APPEND flag, and then seeks
to the beginning of the file before writing some data. Where does the data appear in the file?
Why?

Answer:

The data goes to the end of the file no matter what.
Note the man page entry for O_APPEND flag:

O_APPEND
    The file is opened in append mode.  Before each write(2), 
    the file offset is positioned at the end of the file, as if with lseek(2).  
    The modification of  the  fileoffset and the write operation are performed 
    as a single atomic step.
