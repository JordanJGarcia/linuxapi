Problem:

If you have access to a 32-bit Linux system, modify the program in listing 5-3
to use standard file I/O system calls (open() and lseek()) and the off_t data type.
Compile the program with the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS macro set to 64, and test to show
that a large file can be successfully created.
