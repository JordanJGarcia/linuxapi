Problem:

Implement SETENV() and UNSETENV() using GETENV(), PUTENV() and, where necessary,
code that directly modifies environ. Your version of UNSETENV() should check to see
whether there are multiple definitions of an environment variable, and remove them
all (which is what the glibc version of UNSETENV() does).

NOTE:

I have no idea how there can possibly be multiple defintions of an environment
variable. So I didn't do that check in the code. Sorry
